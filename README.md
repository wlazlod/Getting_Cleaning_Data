## Getting and Cleaning Data - Project

Source dataset https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

*  You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
*  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
*  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Notes

*  Only vaiables containing mean() & std() are used.
*  Requires the plyr & reshape2 packages.
*  Assumes the dataset is unzipped in the current directory.

Constructed using the following:

```R

##  Running

```bash

```

Yields tidy.txt & tidy.mean.txt.
